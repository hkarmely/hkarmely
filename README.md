### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
 ðŸ”­ As of 2022  i 'm curently enjoyng my self with:
- instucting  in Leap learner israel (https://www.leaplearner.co.il/), 
                                             coding Schoole for kids 6-14 (K-14) years old 
- Teaching Universities & Coding Bootcamps students that stuggle with chors and projects via online platforms like: 
                                              https://www.limudnaim.co.il/%D7%9E%D7%95%D7%A8%D7%94-%D7%A4%D7%A8%D7%98%D7%99-%D7%90%D7%95%D7%A0%D7%9C%D7%99%D7%99%D7%9F/%D7%97%D7%9F-%D7%9B%D7%A8%D7%9E%D7%9C%D7%99
                                              
                                              
- âš¡ Some facts about this GitHub account: ...
  Although my Github account is a bit of a mess...
  althoug the first repo was created in april 2016, 
  befor that and since then i have worked wordpress project -> installing wordpress on online hosting, and on local PC's (for development), insstalling and
  tweeking Themes, Plugins, connecting domains and SSL Certificates (If needed), and Third party applications connections (like google analytics, ZOHO CRM real   time traker and more), 
  The nature of the work and the deployment, means that i do not have github repo's for it. 
  But I can easely restore most of such projects with real wordpress application (working online of local) 
   
  Some other code was created for my students, and there for... cannot be presentd in here. 
  Rhat code could be done with some anvanced standard techlologies or tools like Node/Express server of Sequilze ORM from one hand, 
  or some "simple" or complex native JavaScript
